### LOGS
there are two types of app-level logs that are generated here:
1. http.log: HTTP server logs which are generated from user requests on HTTP port
2. rpc.log: RPC logs which are generated from CLI

**NOTE**: you can change the files path from config file using http_log_path and rpc_log_path variables.
